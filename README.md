Very much _**DEPRECATED**_ now, for the record only.

# Package a Symfony2 application using Docker

This repository was created to host some of the resources referred to in the following slideshow

[DÃ©velopper et packager votre application Symfony2 avec Docker et Vagrant](https://speakerdeck.com/thierrymarianne/developper-et-packager-une-application-symfony2-avec-docker)

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/thierrymarianne/symfony2-docker-vagrant.git

## Build and run containers using shell script

### For Linux users

Follow installation instructions for your distribution

[https://docs.docker.com/installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation)

Run the build shell script from wherever this project has been cloned

    # You need to be a privileged user in order to execute docker command
    sudo /bin/bash -c 'cd ./build/shell && source build.sh'

### For MacOSX / Windows users

Install Vagrant by following instructions

[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Install VirtualBox by downloading its latest release available for your operating system

[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnjp](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnjp)

Install Docker by provisioning a vagrant box using shell and puppet

    # Download a vagrant box and install Docker (plus some development tools)
    vagrant up

    # Access the vagrant box
    vagrant ssh

Run the shell script as a privileged user (having permissions to access docker socket)

    sudo /bin/bash -c 'cd /vagrant/build/shell && source build.sh'

### Testing your application and services are running from within the `symfony-standard` container

After entering your application container, your shell shall look like this

    root@<CONTAINER_ID>:/#

Test the availability of Elasticsearch

    curl -XGET 'http://'$SYMFONY__ELASTICSEARCH__PORT_9200_TCP_ADDR':9200

Test the availability of `Not Found` page served by Symfony standard edition via nginx / php-fpm

    curl -XGET http://127.0.0.1

## Build and run containers using fig

### Using vagrant    

    # After having provisioned the same box used in the context of using the shell script above
    vagrant ssh

    sudo /bin/bash -c 'cd /vagrant/build/fig && fig up'

## FAQ

**Provisioning with puppet might fail when the project directory can not be shared for some reason.**

    Shared folders that Puppet requires are missing on the virtual machine.
    This is usually due to configuration changing after already booting the
    machine. The fix is to run a `vagrant reload` so that the proper shared
    folders will be prepared and mounted on the VM.

Execute the following command whenever this error would be occurring

    vagrant reload --provision
